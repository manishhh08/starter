          Software Engineer | Coding Career Coach | I Help Aspiring Developers
          Turn Skills Into Careers <br />
          The transition from learning to earning in tech is tough. I make it
          easier. <br />
          <p>
            As the Founder of Dented Code Academy, I've dedicated my career to
            bridging the gap between education and real-world industry demands.
            Too many aspiring developers struggle with moving from academic
            knowledge to actual job-ready skills. That's why I built a system
            that works—mentorship-driven, industry-focused, and
            outcome-oriented.
